## Description

linkParameters allows Inventor users to easily create dependencies between parameters in various parts and sub-assemblies in the context of the top-level assembly within which they reside.

Parameters can be visually selected from a source component and linked to a specific parameter in a target component creating the dependency. The mechanism employed is based on the iLogic functionality introduced in Inventor 2011. It will automatically generate the iLogic code required to link the values of the parameters, without the need to manually write any iLogic instructions.


Please have a look on this [short](http://coolorange.wistia.com/medias/qa19z6srhp) video that shows how to use linkParameters.
